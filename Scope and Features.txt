Program Must: 

3 Main arguments:
Single Random Planet
Series of Multiple Planet in a system
Intaken values for specific Planet

Readin from files -> Vectors (Main)
Roll Dice for # and specific Traits (Class)
Eliminate and Reroll conflicting or duplicate vlaues (Class) 
Output new Planet -> JSON Txt (Class)

for system of planets:
Must generate a star (assign a grade)
	--> assign number of planets based on grade
Determine gravity well of system for planet placement
	--> Horizontal X axis only assuming circular roation
create planets based on distance from star
	--> if super close, more heat related hazards
	--> if super far, more cold related hazards
